* TODO Look over Data Analysys w/ Open Source book to add content on
- PCA
- Linear Regression
- clustering
- Logistic regression
- Beef up cross validation training description from here
* TODO Might use Data Analysis w/ Open Source book to add SVM section.
* TODO Figure out how to correctly specify links to nbviewer from bitbucket
- I think current links are going to be tied to a particular commit 
  because of the embedded commit id/hash in url
* TODO My example implementation of K-means clustering may be buggy, need to check
* TODO Should probably add example of using K-means to perform classification
- Would be nice to for example have example of drawing a number and classifying it
* DONE Decide what sections/notebooks to create for course

** TODO Rearrange existing units as necessary
* DONE Need to add more to linear regression, use ML4H examples
  CLOSED: [2013-08-28 Wed 08:01]
- Intro to ML4H linear regression has a nice explanation of classification.
* DONE Clean up presentation links on overview

** TODO Clean up the nbviewer links
* DONE Video on Intro to Python and the 0-Python notebook.

* DONE Add implemention of kMeans in python from Collective Intelligence
  CLOSED: [2013-08-24 Sat 13:38]
* DONE Beef up the PCA notebook
