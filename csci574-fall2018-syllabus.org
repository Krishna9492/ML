* Course Description

This semester's AI course will focus on the sub field of machine
learning with some work in the analysis of big data.  We will look at
classic unsupervised and supervised learning methods, used in the
field to classify data, cluster it and find optimizations.  This will
include looking at k-means and hierarchical clustering,
self-organizing maps, linear regression, decision trees, optimization
techniques such as genetic algorithms, etc.  We will cover ways of
getting hold of interesting datasets, ideas on how to collect data
from users, and many different ways to analyze and understand the data
once you've found it.

* Requirements and Objectives

- Explore downloading and mining real web data sets.
- Learn about unsupervised methods for grouping and visualization.
- Program optimization algorithms to search for optimal solutions
  using hill climbing, GA's, etc.
- Become familiar with some advanced classification techniques of the
  kernel methods family of algorithms.

* Student's with Disabilities

The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal
anti-discrimination statute that provides comprehensive civil rights
protection for persons with disabilities.  Among other things, this
legislation requires that all students with disabilities be guaranteed
a learning environment that provides for reasonable accommodation of
their disabilities.  If you have a disability requiring an
accommodation, please contact: Office of Student Disability Resources
and Services, Texas A&M University-Commerce, Gee Library, Room 132,
Phone (903) 886-5150, StudentDisabilityServices@tamuc.edu

* Academic Ethics

"All students enrolled at the University shall follow the tenets of
common decency and acceptable behavior conducive to a positive
learning environment." (See Student's Guide Handbook, Policies and
Procedures, Conduct). Ethics also includes the issue of plagiarism,
and copying code for programming/lab assignments is just as serious as any
other type of plagiarism.  If you are caught sharing or using other
people's work in this class, you will receive a 0 grade and a warning
on the first instance.  A subsequent instance will result in receiving
an F grade for the course, and possible disciplinary proceedings.

* Attendance Policy

Students are expected to follow all instructions and visit eCollege
regularly many times weekly to complete the materials for this online
course.  If a student is unable to submit assignments by the due date
for the assignment, they are expected to make alternative arrangements
to assure that the assignment is turned in ON TIME, before the
assignment is actually due. Any student wishing to withdraw from the
course must do so officially as outlined in the class schedule.  THE
INSTRUCTOR CANNOT DROP OR WITHDRAW ANY STUDENT.

* Course Requirement Deadlines

Credit will be given for ONLY those exam(s), program(s), and/or
project(s) turned in no later than the deadline(s) as announced by the
instructor of this class unless prior arrangement has been made with
the instructor.

* Technology Requirements
This course is a web enhanced course, which means all assignments and
handouts will be distributed and collected through our University's
eCollege online course system.
- To fully participate in online courses you will need to use a current
  browser, such as Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.
- You will need regular access to a computer with a broadband internet
  connection.  The minimum computer requirements are:
  - 512 MB of RAM, 1 GB or more preferred.
  - Broadband connection required by courses that are heavily video intensive.
  - Video display capable of high-color 16-bit display 1024 x 768
    or higher resolution.
- You must have a:
  - Sound card, which is usually integrated into your desktop or laptop
    computer.
  - Speakers or headphones.

* Student Learning Outcomes

1. Develop familarity with high-level Python scripting language.
2. Learn basics of fundamental machine learning techniques, such as
   regression, clustering, k-nearest neighbor,
   kernel methods, etc.
3. Learn basic distinction between supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods.
4. Learn basic machine learning training and testing techniques, including cross validation and data optimization.

Learning outcomes will be measured through mapping assignment and test
questions to specific outcome items, as well as through exit surveys
of student experiences with the outcome familiarity.
